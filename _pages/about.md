I am currently a postdoc researcher at VISTA, LIX, working with [Vicky Kalogeiton](https://vicky.kalogeiton.info). I finished my Ph.D. at Univ Rennes 1, Inria Rennes and IRISA advised by [Marc Christie](https://people.irisa.fr/Marc.Christie/) and [Eric Marchand](https://team.inria.fr/rainbow/fr/team/eric-marchand/). My main research interests lie in visual SLAM, computational cinematography, NeRF, generative models and animation.
